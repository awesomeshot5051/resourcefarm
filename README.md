### THESE UPDATES ONLY APPLY TO THE 1.21.1 VERSION. I AM ACTIVELY WORKING ON V2.0.0 FOR 1.21.3/.4 BUT MOJANG HAS MADE IT VERY CHALLENGING TO DATA GENERATE. BECAUSE OF THIS, IT WILL MOST LIKELY BE SEVERAL MONTHS UNTIL I AM ABLE TO RELEASE AN UPDATE FOR 1.21.3. DO NOT COMPLAIN THAT STUFF ISN'T WORKING FOR 1.21.3 IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THIS!

Similar to my [Mob Farm](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mob-farms-neoforge) and [Plant Farm](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/plant-farms), this helps speed up the production of resources.

*   The recipes are very similar to the other farms. 
*   ALL farms have a tool on it.
*   The heigher the tier, the faster the drop rate.
*   Normal in-game tool requirements still apply. You can't make a diamond farm with a wooden pickaxe.  
    *   Blocks that require a pickaxe, have a pickaxe

*   *   Blocks that require a shovel, have a shovel

*   *   You CAN use tools from other mods, but be warned, while the crafting recipe will work, the rate will default to the wooden rate.
*   Using four materials of your choice, you can upgrade the pickaxe or shovel within the block.

*   You can add enchantmnets to the tool on the block by combing an enchanted book normally compatible with the tool in the crafting grid.
    *   Silk touch will cause the block to drop itself
    *   Efficiency will increase the drop rate.
    *   Fortune on pickaxes will cause blocks to drop more resources
    *   For now, unbreaking does nothing, later on, I might make durability be a thing. I don't know.

*   *   *   You can NOT combine multiple enchantments by putting multiple enchanted books in the crafting grid.

*   *   You can, however, combine multiple enchantments onto one book, then combine that with the farm block in the crafting grid

*   Putting a farm with enchantments with nothing else will remove ALL enchantments![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/description/1164206/description_48aabf5f-2eca-463b-9ff2-7d5628ea31e9.png)![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/description/1164206/description_88d3ef1c-d8d6-42d4-9fba-1bb1a8e0b464.png)
