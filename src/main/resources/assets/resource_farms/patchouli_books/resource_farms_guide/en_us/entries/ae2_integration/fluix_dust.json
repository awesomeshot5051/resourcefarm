Just like with regular AE2 mechanics, you must first activate it. Normally, you would crush Fluix Crystals in an Inscriber. However, if you put a Fluix Crystal in, along with any kind of slab, including modded slabs, it will \"Crush\" the Fluix Crystal for you and produce Fluix Dust. No more annoying Inscriber Crusher Machine sounds!$(br)Using the Speed Upgrade on this farm will increase it's drop rate 2 fold. Meaning it will drop twice as fast."
