Just like in Regular Gameplay, the kind of Shovel determines the \"Mineing Speed\"$(br)Please note that at the moment Modded Shovels do work, but they will default to a Wooden Mining speed and you will be unable to upgrade them. As such, it's suggested to stick to vanilla Shovels. Support for Modded Shovels is a work in progress."
