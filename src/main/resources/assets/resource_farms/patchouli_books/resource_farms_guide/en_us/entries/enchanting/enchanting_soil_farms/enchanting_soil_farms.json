Efficiency will increase the drop rate.$(br)You cannot combine multiple books with the farm at the same time. However, you are able to combine multiple enchantments onto a single book, then combine that with the farm. $(br)If you place the farm in the crafting grid with nothing else, it will remove ALL of the enchantments."
